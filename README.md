# Hi there! I am `t0xic0der`

I am a cybersecurity enthusiast with keen interests in networking, cloud computing and operating systems. I am currently a Cybersecurity Analyst intern at ZeroGons and a contributor at Fedora Project. I have been developing cool application and service projects by [myself](https://github.com/t0xic0der/) and collaboratively with the [AstroSonic](https://github.com/astrosonic/) FOSS community. Along with all the development stuff, I have been exhibiting my presence in virtual platforms like [Medium](https://medium.com/@t0xic0der), [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Akashdeep-Dhar-1) and [AskFedora](https://ask.fedoraproject.org/u/t0xic0der/) with my technical and not-so technical writings.
